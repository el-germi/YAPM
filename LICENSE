NONE, most of the assets are stolen, if you want to use any of the code just use common cortesy (a thank you e-mail or something), if you want to use any of the assets, DON'T, i do NOT hold any right to use nor distribute them.
this is a non-profit pet project
if somehow you own any of the stolen assets and want me to remove them just send me an e-mail & I'll get to it asap
